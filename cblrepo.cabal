synopsis: Tool to maintain a database of CABAL packages and their dependencies
description:
            Helper tool for people maintaining a set of CABAL packages for their
            distribution. It maintains a database of packages and verifies
            dependencies of the entire set as packages are added or updated. It
            also makes it trivial to track packages as new versions are released
            on Hackage.

            It can also be used to build source packages for the Arch Linux
            distribution.
